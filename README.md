# Intro
Although Ruckus provides documentation (e.g. https://support.ruckuswireless.com/documents/3591-cp_es-5-8-ga-rest-api-user-guide) for the Cloudpath API there are no examples in a selection of common scripting languages, with this (super hacky) sample in PowerShell I demonstrate how to download a list of issued DPSKs and then modify a single DPSK to have a modified expiry date.

In time and as the Cloudpath API expands in features I hope to publish further examples, if you have your own please feel free to contribute.
